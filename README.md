# SCBot

SCBot - that stands for Steam Controller Bot - is the custom made discord bot noticeably used in used in r/SonicTheHedgehog discord server. As noted by the name it initially served another purpose - and it was using Python.

Some code in this repo was removed or it's **not** up to date - this is by design - but it is perfectly functional. This repo serves merely to show my work and thought process.
